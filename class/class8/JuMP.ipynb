    "\n",
    "[JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) is a Julia package that provides a modeling language for general optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization in Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia's optimization packages have become popular due to their ease of use, and variety of interfaces to mature solvers.  The main optimization functionality in Julia is provided by [JuliaOpt](http://www.juliaopt.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two high-level interfaces that you are most likely to use are\n",
    "* [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) - a modeling language for all sorts of optimization problems\n",
    "* [Convex.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl) - a package for disciplined convex programming (like [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/))\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a mid-level interface as well, [MathProgBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl).\n",
    "\n",
    "The powerful thing about all of the above is that it is largely **solver independent**. This means you can forumlate the optimization problem with these packages, and then choose from a variety of solvers to use under the hood.  This is just like other modeling languages like AMPL - the reason why Julia's optimization packages have become popular is that they are generally easier to use than older modeling languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "Today is more about turning your optimization models into something that can run on a computer via JuMP, but you still need a solver to actually solve the problem for you under the hood.  [JuliaOpt](http://www.juliaopt.org/) has a list of solvers that can be called from the high level interfaces (there are currently 20).  There are many open-source options available, but there are also interfaces to some of the big commercial solvers such as [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/), [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/), [Knitro](https://www.artelys.com/en/optimization-tools/knitro), etc. Many of these commercial solvers offer free academic/student licences, and if you are trying to solve large optimization problems they may be worth looking at."
